### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_student 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="976" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object and `Lesson` object residing in the `Model`.

In addition to displaying students via `ListPanel` and `ListCard`, the `UI` also supports displaying lessons. This is achieved through:
* `LessonListPanel`: a JavaFX `UI` component that lists all lessons in the application. It is managed by the MainWindow class.
* `LessonCard`: a reusable `UI` part that renders information about a single lesson (e.g. subject, time, and date) using FXML and JavaFX. It is used within `LessonListPanel`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_student 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_student 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteStudentCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteStudentCommandParser`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram-Class_Diagram__Student_Management_Structure.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` and `Lesson` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` and `UniqueLessonList` object respectively).
* maintains a list of currently selected `Student` and `Lesson` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate filtered lists, each exposed as an unmodifiable`ObservableList<Student>` and `ObservableList<Lesson>` that can be observed. This allows the UI to bind to these lists so that it automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Name` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` and `Lesson` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Name` object per unique name, instead of each `Student` and `Lesson` needing their own `Name` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTutorTrack`. It extends `TutorTrack` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `tutorTrackStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTutorTrack#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current TutorTrack state in its history.
* `VersionedTutorTrack#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous TutorTrack state from its history.
* `VersionedTutorTrack#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone TutorTrack state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTutorTrack()`, `Model#undoTutorTrack()` and `Model#redoTutorTrack()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTutorTrack` will be initialized with the initial TutorTrack state, and the `currentStatePointer` will point to that single TutorTrack state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. TThe user executes the command `delete_student 5` to delete the 5th student in TutorTrack. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitTutorTrack()`, causing the modified state after the command execution to be saved in the `tutorTrackStateList`. The `currentStatePointer` shifts to the newly added state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add_student n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add_student` command also calls `Model#commitTutorTrack()`, causing another modified TutorTrack state to be saved into the `tutorTrackStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0 (the initial state), there are no earlier states to restore. `Model#canUndoTutorTrack()` checks this and returns an error if undo is not possible.
</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTutorTrack()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous TutorTrack state, and restores the previous state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial TutorTrack state, then there are no previous states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTutorTrack()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command reverses the undo. It calls `Model#redoTutorTrack()`, shifting the `currentStatePointer` one step forward to restore the next state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is already at the latest state (i.e., index `tutorTrackStateList.size() - 1`), `redo` is not possible. `Model#canRedoTutorTrack()` handles this check.

</div>

Step 5. The user executes a non-mutating command like `list`. Such commands do not modify the state and do not trigger any undo/redo behavior. The `tutorTrackStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`. Since `clear` calls `Model#commitTutorTrack()` and the `currentStatePointer` is not at the latest state, all states after the pointer are purged â€” making redo impossible. This mirrors typical desktop application behavior.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire addressbook.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete_student`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
