**TutorTrack provides a CLI-based, lightweight tutor management system**  that allows tutors to:
- Quickly organise student contact details.
- Track lesson schedules.
- Log student progress.

This ensures seamless access to critical information without switching between multiple apps, allowing tutors to focus on teaching while maintaining an organised workflow.

* If you are interested in using TutorTrack, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TutorTrack, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
